## Version

1.0.0

See all [get-fattura-pa releases](https://github.com/frnmst/get-fattura-pa/releases).

## Definitions

The following terms are used throughout this document and within the source 
code.

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| checksum | a file integrity check |
| signed file | the invoice file signed using a PKCS # 7 system |
| certificate | proves that the public key used for the signature is authentic |
| metadata file | a file that contains the checksum of the signed file as well as other information |
| original file | the invoice file without the signature |
| attachments | user certain conditions, the files encoded as base64 binaries in the original file |

## Examples

- Given a metadata file called `document.xml` and a signed file called 
  `document.xml.p7m`, you can verify and extract the original file
  and attachments with the following command:

      $ ./get_fattura_pa document.xml document.xml.p7m

- If you are not in possession of the metadata file or there is a problem with 
  it, you may also skip the checksum:

      $ ./get_fattura_pa --ignore-checksum /dev/null document.xml.p7m

## Help

```
Usage: get_fattura_pa [OPTION] METADATA_FILE SIGNED_FILE
The purpose of this script is exclusively to read invoices received from the
*Sistema di Interscambio*

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
Options:
    -c, --ignore-checksum                   avoid checksum comparision between
                                            the metadata file and the signed
                                            file
    -e, --ignore-certificate                avoid checking the certificate
                                            used by the signer
    -f, --force-certificates-download       update the certificate list even if
                                            a certificate file is already
                                            present
    -h, --help                              print this help
    -n, --no-extract-attachments            avoid extracting possible
                                            attachments if the original
                                            file is an XML file
    --print-flags                           print the enabled options. This can also
                                            be used to print the default options
    -q, --quiet                             show errors and hide every other
                                            output
    -s, --ignore-signature                  avoid checking the cryptographic
                                            signature of the file

Exit status:
 0  if OK,
 1  if an error occurred.
